## Calculate Surface Area of a Figure.
By using the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, you are required to design a program that calculate the total surface area of a figure. <br />
The following are the requirements an constraints :<br />
- You should have a Class/Interface called Shape and decide its appropriate attributes and behaviours<br />
- You should have basic shapes like Square, Rectangle, Circle and Triangle.<br />
- The program will request the user to :<br />
   1. enter the total number of shapes<br />
   2. choose the shape and enter the required dimension/s for the selected shape<br />
   3. choose the type of calculation (for now, we will just calculate Area, with future plan to calculate Volume as well).<br />
- The calculation/s should be done upon user’s request and NOT when dimensions are entered.<br /><br />

1. For a start, use the 2-D figure on the right to verify your program. The figure consists of a Circle (radius=10), a Triangle (height=25, base =20) and a Rectangle (length=50, breadth = 20) . Calculate the total area of the 2- D figure.
(You will create an Application class Shape2DApp.java for this purpose)<br />
2. We will now expand and extend your design to cater to 3-D figures. Imagine the figure on the right is turn into a 3-D figure – Circle becomes Sphere, Triangle becomes a square-based Pyramid and the Rectangle is a cubiod. Calculate the total surface area of the 3- D figure. Note : You need to think whether ‘is a’ or ‘has a’ relationship is more appropriate and relevant for between 2D and 3D shapes.
(You will create an Application class Shape3DApp.java for this purpose)<br />
3. We will include more Shapes. The square-based Pyramid will be replaced with a Cone and the Cubiod is replaced with a Cylinder. Calculate the total surface area of the new 3- D figure.
(You will reuse the Application class Shape3DApp.java with appropriate selection)
